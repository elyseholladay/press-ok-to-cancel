						<p>When I worked at Bazaarvoice, we built consumer product rating and review software. When someone submitted a review on a product, they could add related products, like a game to a review of a Wii. This feature had super-high conversion rates but was never used—and I suspect not by anyone who had built it, either.</p>
						<p>I ran some user tests, and it turned out that the search was based on the number of times the search result came up—nothing else. So if you searched for “macbook” you would get “Macbook Case for Macbook Pro 13 and Macbook Pro 15 and Macbook Pro 17” rather than the actual Macbook, which might appear on page five—which users never got to.</p>
						<p>So we built a new prototype and bumped search results based on the number of reviews a product has; most likely a Macbook Pro has more reviews than a case. Time to find the right product dropped from 2 minutes to :15-:45 seconds.</p>

							<p>If you are a developer, congrats, you are also a copywriter. But when was the last time you thought about what you wrote in an app? </p>

						<aside class="notes">
							<p>Alex Sexton wrote a great post called the UX of Language, and he says, "If you can go through your app and find any sentence that you’d write differently if it wasn’t generated by a computer, you are reducing the effectiveness of that text and degrading the overall experience"</p>
							<p>At Square Root, our yml file of translatable text in our app was eleven hundred lines long. That's a lot of text! There were plenty of error messages in there, and many of them reused across different parts of the app. Understanding where they are used is the first step to avoiding "Press OK to Cancel" instructions; being able to have human-sounding language is even better.</p>

"No results found" definitely sounds like a computer wrote it, even if it was actually a developer taking a first pass.

							<p>what is the point if not to have our users find, understand, and enjoy using the CONTENT of the app we provide. At Square Root it was data reporting and analysis that helped them do their jobs; at MakerSquare it's finding information about learning to code; maybe it's Instagram photos, or how to use your Sass plugin. Either way, if they can't get to what they want, you're wasting their time—and yours.</p>

						<aside class="notes">
							<p>Maybe Steve had a designer who told him there always had to be 2 buttons on every alert dialog, and a front-end dev who told him he had to use the common alert markup and buttons, so everything would be styled consistently.</p>

							<p>So he's writing this feature, and pulls in this common HTML, and of course the button text itself is in a different file, so it can be translated to other languages, and so.. OK, this seems alright. I'm doing the right thing.</p>

							<p>Then it's built, and during QA, someone goes, "Hey! This dialog says "are you sure you want to cancel?" and the buttons are OK and Cancel. That doesn't make sense. I have an idea: let's add more instructions."</p>

							<p>And thus, "Click OK to cancel the current action, or Cancel to continue" was born. All out of trying to do the right thing.</p>

							<p>But for our friend Steve, when he was making this alert, when he looked at the code, was it clear where the buttons would end up, what they would say, and what their context was?</p>

							<p>I really love Bower for things like CSS frameworks; Bower allows you to pull in assets like Zurb Foundation, instead of installing it separately. So instead of having to rip out a bunch of stuff when you want to update, you can update pretty seamlessly behind the scenes.</p>
							<p>Tools like Grunt or precommit hooks built into your git flow can also help us automate manual tasks that we might otherwise skip, like strippig unused selectors, minifying files, and precompiling and gzipping assets before they're uploaded.</p>

						<h2>don't give users unoccupied time</h2>
						<h6>speed</h6>
						<aside class="notes">
							<p>I read an article about the Houston airport, in which passengers were complaining that the wait to get their luggage was too long. They added more baggage people, got the bags off the planes and to the claim faster... and people still complained.</p>

							<p>Turns out, it took passengers a minute to walk from their arrival gates to baggage claim and seven more minutes to get their bags. Roughly 88 percent of their time, in other words, was spent standing around waiting for their bags.</p>

							<p>So the airport decided on a new approach: they moved the gates and baggage claim FARTHER away from each other, so it took six times longer to get there. Complaints dropped to near zero.</p>

							<p>Occupied time (walking to baggage claim) feels shorter than unoccupied time (standing at the carousel).</p>

							<p>and the worst kind of unoccupied time? waiting for the train schedule to load on your phone... while you are waiting for the train... while you are late to a work meeting... before you have had any coffee.</p>

						<aside class="notes">

							<p>The critical path is the path from the user following a link to the working experience.</p>

							<p>CSS blocks rendering, so you need to deal with it right away—browsers will download all CSS, sometimes even print stylesheets, before it can render the page. And if we're waiting on the rendering, the user is waiting.</p>

							<p>JS blocks downloads, so you need to deal with these last. Browsers block parallel downloads with JavaScript so that it doesn’t start downloading jQuery and your plugin at the same time; it should be pretty obvious that if you were to start downloading both in parallel, your plugin would arrive before jQuery would. Your script might alter the page, meaning the browser will have to deal with that before it can move on to anything else.</p>

							<p>Think about this: you have an HTML page; without the HTML, there is no path really. Game over. Without images? You can live without images most of the time. Without JavaScript? hopefully you'll have a good fallback. Without webfonts? You're kidding me, I don't need no stinkin' fonts when I'm late and running to the airport and checking in for the flight on the damn phone with the spotty mobile network  mobile.southwest.com wants to look like native iPhone and won't let me click until mountains of JS arrive, so no, no, we do not need webfonts.</p>

							<p>What's left on the critical path is CSS. If the page is ugly without CSS, we can live with that, but there is no page without CSS because the browser waits and waits and takes forever to timeout showing us a blank white page.</p>

							<!-- <p>Chris Coyier gave a great talk on "simple stuff we can do to make websites faster," which outlined this.</p> -->
							<p>obviously, first, the less stuff we send down the tubes, the better. when you can replace an image with CSS, that's great; if you can use 2 weights of font instead of 6, great. Refactoring your CSS to remove unused selectors is pretty trivial when you compare it to removing a JS lib or an image, but it can still be valuable. </p>
							<p>At Square Root I wrote our original Sass architecture; after about a year and a half, I did a pretty big refactor using Susy, removing some old CSS we didn't need, and making sure that IE didn't download any of the media query wrapped styles. I cut about 50kb out just doing that, and more for IE.</p>
							<p>Then we split the CSS out into what the homepage needed—which was about 100kb—versus what the rest of the pages and apps needed—which was about 225kb, which we could lazy-load after everything was done. Combine that with gzip and an amazon CDN, coupled with some JS refactoring, we gained almost an entire second of load time.</p>

						<h3 class="quote">"Typically the cleaner your markup ends up, the smaller your CSS will be, and the easier redesigning and editing will be in the future. It saves you not just page load time, but development time too."</h3>
						<p class="quote-source">Lara Swanson</p>
						<aside class="notes">
							<p>I firmly believe that when your code is good, you enable yourself to create a better experience for your users. If you can keep your HTML and CSS, your JS and views and controllers, all named consistently, organized, and human readable, it's easier to spot where your language is out of context, where the UI might be inconsistent, or what might need refactoring.</p>
							<p>If you have a dev setup that encourages and allows you to find the right code, reuse it and refactor it, you are more likely to do the right thing—for yourself, your team, and ultimately your users, too.</p>

                    	<p>So: occasionally look at your app through the eyes of your users, to understand what it is they experience. Looking at it on your local environment is not enough. Go to production, download the app on your phone, read your website with fresh eyes.</p>
                    	<p>Think about what you are writing, and the context in which it appears. Whether it's code names, comments, or error messages, context and clarity matter. In your code, being consistent in your naming, your styles, and your workflow can help you cut down on UI bugs and find the right code fast.</p>
                    	<p>And last but of course not least, ask yourself when you add code or files, "is this worth it?". Speed-test your pages.. and then go check it out like a user and see if it's acceptable.</p>
