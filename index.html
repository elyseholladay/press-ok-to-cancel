What the app does brilliantly is to show you the first checkmark immediately. It may not have been fully sent, but it will probably get there, so let's go ahead and show that check.

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>When I worked at Bazaarvoice, we worked on consumer product rating and review software. When a user submitted a review on a product, they could add related products, like a game to a review of a Wii. This feature had super-high conversion rates but was never used. I ran some user tests, and it turned out that the search was based on the number of times the search result came up—nothing else. So if you searched for “macbook” you would get “Macbook Case for Macbook Pro 13” and Macbook Pro 15”” rather than the actual Macbook, which might appear on page five. </p>

						<p>So we built a demo and bumped search results based on the number of reviews a product has; most likely a Macbook Pro has more reviews than a case. Time to find the right product dropped from 2 minutes to :15-:45 seconds.</p>

						<h2>Say that again?</h2>

						<aside class="notes">
							<p>If you are a developer, congrats, you are also a copywriter. But when was the last time you thought about what you wrote in an app? </p>

							<p>And before you say it's that a designer's job, when did a designer last provide you a list of say, error messages? And if they did, was it a list contain contextual clues about where that error message appears?</p>

							&#8220;If you can go through your app and find any sentence that you’d write differently if it wasn’t generated by a computer, you are reducing the effectiveness of that text and degrading the overall experience.&#8221;
						</h3>
						<p class="quote-source">Alex Sexton</p>
						<aside class="notes">
							<p>At my last job, our yml file of translatable text in our app was eleven hundred lines long. That's a lot of text! There were plenty of error messages in there, and many of them reused across different parts of the app. Understanding where they are used is the first step to avoiding "Press OK to Cancel" instructions; being able to have human-sounding language is even better.</p>

							<p>In all of these cases, we aimed for providing a little more context, and a lot more friendliness. "No results found" is definitely a computer-sounding sentence, even if it wasn't REALLY computer generated. Letting our users know we understand what they typed—and showing it again in case they typo'd it—help them not be frustrated by a dead-end search.</p>

							<p>Here's another Alex quote—what is the point if not to have our users find, understand, and enjoy using the CONTENT of the app we provide.

						<aside class="notes">
							<p>Maybe Bob had a designer who told him there always had to be 2 buttons on every alert dialog, and a front-end dev who told him he had to use the common alert markup and buttons, so everything would be styled consistently.</p>

							<p>So he's writing this feature, and pulls in this common HTML, and of course the button text itself is in a different file, so it can be translated to other languages, and so.. OK, this seems good.</p>

							<p>Then it's built, and during QA, someone goes, "Hey! This dialog says "are you sure you want to cancel?" and the buttons are just OK and Cancel. That doesn't make sense. I have an idea: let's add more instructions."</p>

							<p>And thus, "Click OK to cancel the current action, or Cancel to continue" was born. All out of trying to do the right thing.</p>

							<p>But for our friend Bob there, when he was making this modal, when he looked at the code, was it clear where the buttons would end up, what they would say, and what their context was?</p>

						<h2>don't give users unoccupied time</h2>

						<aside class="notes">
							<p>I read an article about the Houston airport, in which passengers were complaining that the wait to get their luggage was too long. They added more baggage people, got the bags off the planes and to the claim faster... and people still complained.</p>

							<p>Turns out, it took passengers a minute to walk from their arrival gates to baggage claim and seven more minutes to get their bags. Roughly 88 percent of their time, in other words, was spent standing around waiting for their bags.</p>

							<p>So the airport decided on a new approach: they moved the gates and baggage claim FARTHER away from each other, so it took six times longer to get there. Complaints dropped to near zero.</p>

							<p>Occupied time (walking to baggage claim) feels shorter than unoccupied time (standing at the carousel).</p>

						<h3>Critical Path</h3>
						<h5 class="fragment">CSS blocks rendering; load them first</h5>
						<h5 class="fragment">JS blocks downloads; load them last</h5>
						<aside class="notes">

							The critical path is the path from the user following a link to the working experience.

							CSS blocks rendering, so you need to deal with it right away (i.e. at the top of the document, in your <head>).
							JS blocks downloads, so you need to deal with these last to ensure that they don’t hold up anything else on the page.

							It’s also worth noting that a browser will download all CSS before it will begin rendering your page

							http://csswizardry.com/2013/01/front-end-performance-for-web-designers-and-front-end-developers/

							CSS is one of performance’s worst enemies, as outlined by Stoyan Stefanov, because of this rendering blockage. It’s also worth noting that a browser will download all CSS before it will begin rendering your page. This means that your print.css will be requested even if the browser is only rendering a page on screen. It means that any stylesheets that are only used based on a media query (e.g. <link rel="stylesheet" media="screen and (min-device-width: 800px)" href="desktop.css">) will still be downloaded even if they aren’t needed.

						<aside class="notes">

							Think about this: you have an HTML page; without the HTML, there is no path really. Game over. Without images? You can live without images most of the time. Without JavaScript? hopefully you'll have a good fallback. Without webfonts? You're kidding me, I don't need no stinkin' fonts when I'm late and running to the airport and checking in for the flight on the damn phone with the spotty mobile network  mobile.southwest.com wants to look like native iPhone and won't let me click until mountains of JS arrive, so no, no, we do not need webfonts.

							What's left on the critical path is CSS. If the page is ugly without CSS, we can live with that, but there is no page without CSS because the browser waits and waits and takes forever to timeout showing us a blank white page.

						<h3>scripts alter pages, so we have to wait for them</h3>
						<aside class="notes">
							a browser will download as many assets as it can from a single domain in parallel. The more domains it is pulling from, the more assets can be downloaded, in parallel, at once.

							JavaScript interrupts this process, blocking parallel downloads from any and all domains, because:

							The script being called might alter the page, meaning the browser will have to deal with that before it can move on to anything else. In order for it to deal with that eventuality it stops downloading anything else in order to focus soleley on that.
							Scripts usually need to be loaded in a certain order for them to work, for example, loading jQuery before you load a plugin. Browsers block parallel downloads with JavaScript so that it doesn’t start downloading jQuery and your plugin at the same time; it should be pretty obvious that if you were to start downloading both in parallel, your plugin would arrive before jQuery would.
